# Post-Printing

## Step 1 - Mount support frame

- Put the support frame between the two PCBs. You don't wanna destroy the SMD parts under the screen PCB. Orient the support frame as shown in the pictures
- Begin with the bottom left hole and use a screw to fix the frame
- Rotate the frame around the Display until all holes are in aligned and in sync between support frame and display. You need to bend the frame a little bit.

## Step 4 - Connect the top and bottom shell
