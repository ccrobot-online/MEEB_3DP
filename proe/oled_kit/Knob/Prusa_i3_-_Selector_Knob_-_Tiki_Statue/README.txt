# Summary

Getting Tiki with it... as a Prusa i3 Selector Dial.

In M훮ori mythology, Tiki is the first man created by either T큰matauenga or T훮ne. He found the first woman, Marikoriko, in a pond; she seduced him and he became the father of Hine-kau-ataata. By extension, a tiki is a large or small wooden or stone carving in humanoid form, although this is a somewhat archaic usage in the M훮ori language. Carvings similar to tikis and coming to represent deified ancestors are found in most Polynesian cultures. They often serve to mark the boundaries of sacred or significant sites.
